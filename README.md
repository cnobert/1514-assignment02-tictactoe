Create a working Tic Tac Toe game. 

1. (3 marks) Have the game board accept player moves by storing where they clicked their letter to be, and drawing a letter (X or O) in that stored location. Both players use the same mouse (the first click is the move for X, the next click is the move for O, etc.). 
Finishing the game. Select one of the given types of finishes to earn the indicated marks: 

2. (1 mark) Simple finish: have the game finish when the board is full 

3. (3 marks) Sophisticated finish: 

    1. (2/3 marks) Have the game detect when a player has won. 
  
    2. (1/3 marks) Make the game recognize and react to ties. 
  
4. (1 mark) Once the game is finished, set the state appropriately and draw a message to the screen (on a blank background) indicating who won. Allow the player to start a new game without having to close the window. 

5. (1 mark) Fancy finish: if there is a winner, indicate the winning line of letters onthe "game over" screen. Do this by drawing a line through them or making them flash (or whatever way you want). 

6. (1 mark) The code is perfectly indented, and uses the data structure (2D array) and switch statements (state machine) shown in class.
